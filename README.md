# Modified-Chess
A chess with some modifications as: choosing the number of pieces per player, being half of them pawns, 1 king and the rest random pieces; starting positions chosen by the player when selecting the king's column; a new invented piece.
It is a C++ project. At the very beginning you must choose the game mode, which can be 1vs1 or 1vsPC. In the case of 1vsPC the PC's movements are going to be random, (I'm not that in into AI)
Then you will select the number of pieces per player, from 2 to 16. Half of them are going to be pawns, 1 is going to be a king and the rest will be random.
Among the random pieces you may find Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen and Apolo. Apolo is an invented piece which moves similar to a Knight, only
that it can jump 2+2, instead of 2+1 as the Knight does.
It is also possible to save the game into a .txt file, where it will save the pieces and their corresponding positions.
